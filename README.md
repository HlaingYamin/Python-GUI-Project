# Python-GUI-Project
This is my first python project named "Stock Management System for a Grocery".
In my project, there are two roles, admin and cashier.
Admin can manage CRUD of products,employees and change prices of all products by percentage.
Cashier can search product by product_id and record the sale .He/she cannot edit product detail.
I used Python 3, Visual Studio Code, MySql and QT Designer for GUI.
